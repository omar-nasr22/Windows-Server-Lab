Windows Server Clean Lab – Technical Notes

1. Server Configuration
- Installed Windows Server on a virtual machine.
- Configured a static IP address to ensure stable communication.
- Promoted the server to a Domain Controller.
- Created a new Active Directory forest (lab.local).
- DNS was installed automatically with AD DS.

2. Active Directory Structure
- Created Organizational Units (OUs) for departments:
  IT, HR, Finance, Sales.
- Created security groups for each department.
- Created domain users and assigned them to the appropriate groups.
- Group-based management was used instead of assigning permissions directly to users.

- Configured DHCP options:
  - Default Gateway
  - DNS Server (Domain Controller)
  - Domain Name (lab.local)

4. Client Machine
- Created a Windows client virtual machine.
- Client successfully received an IP address from DHCP.
- Client machine joined the lab.local domain.
- Verified domain login using standard domain users.

5. Group Policy Implementation
- Created a Group Policy Object (HR-Restrictions) to restrict Control Panel access for HR users.
- Created a Group Policy Object (IT-Map-Drive) to map a network drive automatically for IT users.
- Policies were linked to the appropriate Organizational Units.
- Group Policy functionality was verified on client machines.

6. Testing and Validation
- Tested user login with different department users.
- Verified Group Policy application using gpupdate and user testing.
- Confirmed network drive availability and permissions.

This lab simulates a small enterprise Windows Server environment and focuses on core system administration and help desk tasks.
